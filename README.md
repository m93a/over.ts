# over.ts
A minimalistic TypeScript library which provides a convenient way to implement overloaded functions. Inspired by [`typed-function`](https://github.com/josdejong/typed-function/), over.ts uses a similar syntax, but unlike it and most of its alternatives, over.ts also produces a function with the correct TypeScript types.
